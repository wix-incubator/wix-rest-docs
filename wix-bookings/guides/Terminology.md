# Wix Bookings Terminology

[Wix Bookings](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-wix-bookings) allows business owners to accept and manage bookings for their services.

This article contains a comprehensive list of the various terms and concepts used in all of Wix Bookings and its APIs.

| Term | Definition |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| [Appointment](https://support.wix.com/en/article/creating-the-right-booking-service-for-your-business#appointments) | A specific time slot that a customer can book in a calendar. For example, your hair salon is open Monday to Friday from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM. Customers can book a session at any available time during these hours. |
| Appointment schedule | Determines when customers can book a session for an appointment service. Customer can book the service based on the business opening hours, session duration, time between sessions, and schedules of the staff members who provide the service.<br />For example, your hair salon is open Monday to Friday from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM. Your salon offers options for both 30-minute or 1-hour haircuts. You have 2 staff members, one available from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM and the other available from 11:00 AM to 7:00 PM. And you've set 15 minute buffers between sessions. Then, customers can book appointments for a specific time if the relevant service and at least one of your staff members has no other appointment from 15 minutes before the proposed session start to 15 minutes after the session end. |
| Availability | Free time on an appointment schedule that customers can book. |
| Booking | Information about the service that the customer has booked. You can think of a booking as an order placed by a customer for a service. Includes details about the time, location, participants, and price. |
| Business owner | The owner of the business that offers services through Wix. Can be a different person than the site owner. The business owner makes decisions such as confirming or declining a booking.
| [Calendar](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-bookings-about-the-wix-booking-calendar) | General overview about the availability and bookings of the business, including its services and resources. You can manage appointments, classes, and courses on the calendar. |
| `CANCELED` (Booking status) | Indicates that the booking has been cancelled by the site owner or the customer. Cancel bookings using [Cancel Booking](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings/bookings-and-time-slots/bookings-v2/bookings-v2-and-confirmation/bookings-cancel-booking). |
| Catalog | A list of all the different services a business provides. |
| Category (Service)| Label to group services. This helps the business owner, your app and customers to filter services. |
| Checkout | Customers must complete the [checkout](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/e-commerce/checkout/introduction) when booking a service.|
| Choice (Pricing) | A specific value for a service option that customers can book. For example, the service option `ageGroup` may have these choices: `child`, `student`, `adult`, and `senior`. Each choice may have a different price. |
| [Class](https://support.wix.com/en/article/creating-the-right-booking-service-for-your-business#classes) | A single session or set of sessions that a business offers on specific days at a specific time. You can schedule class sessions on different weekdays, at different times, and with different resources (including different staff members). Customers can sign up for a single or more sessions of the class. This is in contrast to courses where customers must book all sessions. For example, your language school offers a class for open discussions in Spanish every Monday at 8:00 PM. Customers can book a single or multiple sessions of the class. |
| Class schedule | Before offering a class or course service, the business owner must decide when to schedule sessions. This is in contrast to appointment services, where customers are free to decide when they want to book a session. Wix uses the class schedule to calculate which sessions are still available. |
| `CONFIRMED` (Booking status)  | Indicates that the business owner has confirmed the booking and that it appears in the business calendar. You can confirm your bookings in different ways:<br />- Automatically. Bookings are automatically confirmed when the service is configured to do so and the order is approved during the checkout process. An automatic confirmation includes checking availability.<br />- Manually. You can manually confirm a booking using `Confirm Or Decline Booking`. |
| [Course](https://support.wix.com/en/article/creating-the-right-booking-service-for-your-business#courses) | Courses start and end on pre-defined dates with a limited number of sessions. For example, an academic course or fitness boot camp during the summer holidays. For both class and course services the business owner must decide in advance when to schedule sessions. For courses customers must book all sessions, while they're free to book only a single or some sessions for classes. |
| Course schedule | Before offering a course service, the business owner must decide when to schedule sessions. This is in contrast to appointment services, where customers are free to decide when they want to book a session. Wix uses the course schedule to calculate availability, when the first session starts, and when the last session ends. |
| Deposit | Amount the customer must pay immediately when checking out the booking. |
| Double booking | A double booking happens when a customer attempts to book an already-reserved service. This can occur when multiple customers are checking out at the exact same time or when the business owner manually confirms more bookings than the service's capacity allows. |
| Extended booking | In addition to basic information about the booking, an extended booking contains additional details. For example, attendance details, and whether the customer can demand a refund or reschedule the booking. |
| External calendar | A calender hosted by a 3rd-party provider. |
| External calendar connection | A linkage between a Wix Bookings calendar and one or more external calendars. External calendar connections allow you to import and export calendar events. |
| External calendar event | A single session or an instance of recurring session that appears in a calendar at a specific time. For example, an appointment or a class session. |
| External calendar provider | The 3rd-party service that provides an external calendar. For example, [Google](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/overview), [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/calendar), or [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/calendar?view=graph-rest-1.0). |
| External calendar resource | A resource that doesn't have a Wix Bookings calendar. Instead, the resource's availability is managed with an external calendar. For example, your app or the business owner has decided to manage one of their staff member's availability through the staff member's Gmail account and a Google calendar. |
| Form | The booking form that's displayed to customers in the Wix site when they book the service. For example, customers can input their name into the bookings form. |
| Integration | Provision of extended functionality from a service provider to a Wix site. The extended functionality is implemented by the 3rd-party service provider using their API, and made available to the Wix site using Wix SPIs. For example, you, as a pricing provider, can offer custom varied pricing options to a Wix site using the [Wix Bookings Pricing Integration REST SPI](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-bookings/pricing-integration-spi). |
| Locked session | A session for a class that customers can't book. For example, because the session is full, has a waitlist, or an administrator needs to manually screen each customer before adding them to the session. |
| Member | Someone who is a registered [member](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/crm/members-contacts/members/members/introduction) in the Wix site and has a login. |
| Merchant | The business that offers services to customers. The merchant has a Wix site for their business, unless your app is working with a [Headless](https://dev.wix.com/docs/go-headless/getting-started/about-headless/about-wix-headless) project. |
| Option (Pricing) | The pricing possibilities for the service. For example, a service may have different options based on which staff member provides the service, the age of the customer, the time of the appointment, or the type of equipment. Each option has a list of supported choices. Options may affect the service price. |
| `PENDING` (Booking status) | Indicates that the booking is waiting to be confirmed or declined. Bookings in `PENDING` status are displayed in the business calendar. Bookings are automatically set as `PENDING` when an [eCommerce order](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/e-commerce/orders/introduction) related to the booking has been created. |
| Policy (Bookings) | Rules set by the merchant about booking a service or cancelling the booking. For example, how far in advance customers are allowed to book a service, until what point before the session start customers can cancel, or the maximum number of participants customers can add to a single booking. |
| Pricing provider | A 3rd-party app that implements custom logic for determining the price of a booking with the [Pricing Integration Service Plugin](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings/pricing/pricing-integration-spi/introduction). |
| Resource | A business asset. For example, a staff member, a room, or equipment that's needed to provide a service. Each resource owns a schedule that defines the resource's availability. Resources can be “booked” or linked to a booking. |
| Schedule | A collection of all sessions that belong to the same service or resource. A schedule also contains information needed to calculate availability. See appointment schedule, class schedule, and course schedule for more information. |
| Service | Business offering. You can offer classes, courses, or appointment-based services. For example, a fitness studio may offer a 1-hour yoga class every Monday at 7:00 PM, an introductory HITT course of 5 training sessions on specific dates, and a 30 minute 1-on-1 personal training on appointment basis. See appointment, class, and course for more information. |
| Status (Booking) | Information about the life cycle status of the booking. Possible statuses include: `CREATED`, `PENDING`, `CONFIRMED`, `DECLINED`, `WAITING-LIST`, `UPDATED`, `CANCELED`. |
| Status (Service) | Information about the status of a service. Statuses include: `ACTIVE`, `DELETED`.
| Session | An occupied or reserved period of time for an appointment, class, or course, or a period of availability for a resource. You can also think of a session as a time-specific instance of a service. Sessions are the building blocks of appointments, classes, and courses. Each of these types of services comprise sessions. The collection of related sessions for a service represent the service's schedule. |
| Slot | An available period of time in a schedule that can be booked by a customer. While this includes existing sessions that are available for booking, it can also represent a period of time that can be booked based on the availability of a resource, such as a barber with appointments of 30 minutes each that are open for booking every weekday between 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM. These slots are calculated according to the constraints of the schedule. | 
| [Service Provider Interface (SPI)](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/getting-started/service-provider-interface#getting-started_service-provider-interface_introduction) | An API specification that is implemented by service providers on their side to provide a specific service to a Wix, such as customized tax or shipping rates.

| Site owner | The person managing the merchant's Wix site (which has Wix Bookings installed). This includes site contributors. |
| Suggested participant (Waitlist) | When a spot opens up in a session with a waitlist, the session is locked for bookings from any participant, other than the participant that is currently in queue in the waitlist - so that only the "suggested" participant is able to book the session. |
| Variant (Pricing) | Unique variation of the service. Variants are defined by the combination of choices. For example: `{"time": "afternoon", "ageGroup": "adult", "equipment": "kettlebells"}`. Each variant may have a different price. |
| [Varied pricing](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-bookings-understanding-price-options) | The ability to charge for services based on different factors, such as the staff member providing the service or the equipment needed.  |
| Visitor | Anyone who isn't registered as a member or hasn't logged in to the Wix site. If a visitor creates a booking they're added as a contact. |
