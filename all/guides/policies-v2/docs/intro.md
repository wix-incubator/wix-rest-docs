# About Policies v2

With Policies APIs, you can manage the policies for a particular event. For example, you can create, update, and delete policies. You can also reorder policies in the Event Dashboard and checkout form.    

Policies define terms & conditions for the events, such as terms for canceling attendance, transferring a ticket to another person, and so on. For example: "Participants are entitled to a 100% refund if canceling attendance 1 week prior to the event. After this date, participants will be refunded 50% of the ticket price."    

A policy agreement checkbox will be added to the RSVP or checkout form. The policy text can be read in a pop-up window if you click the policy name. By default, there are no policies when you first create an event.

## Terminology

- **Policy**: text that defines terms & conditions, as relevant.
- **Event Dashboard**: control center, which allows you to manage their site events settings and features.
- **Checkout form**: the final step in the ticket purchasing process where the customer fills in personal info, reads policies, and pays.
