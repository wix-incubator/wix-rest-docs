# About Wix Groups


With [Wix Groups](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-groups-about-groups) site owners can offer their members places to participate in discussions, share media and more.

Media in Wix Groups is organized in a gallery.

Site owners can set whether members are allowed to create groups, or add new members to a group.


## Terminology


- **Group**: Place where members can connect with each other to get updates and share media.
- **Group Member**: Site member that has joined a group.

  >**Note:** The Wix Groups API doesn't assign group members a unique ID. Instead, it uses the `memberId` from the [Members API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/members/members/about-wix-members) for identification.
- **Group List**: List of groups displayed in the Wix Groups app home page.

  >**Note:** Depending on the viewer's role (see [Roles](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-groups/groups/introduction#wix-groups_groups_introduction_roles)), not all groups will be displayed.
