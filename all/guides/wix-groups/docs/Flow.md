# Sample Use Cases & Flow: Social Groups

## Create a Group for a Predefined List of People
For example, create a group for each class at a school or each fitness class (yoga, TRX, etc) in a gym.

1. Create a list of site members to add to the relevant group, identified by one of the following: name, email address, phone number, contactId.
2. Create a group by calling the [Create Group](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/community/wix-groups/groups/create-group) endpoint.
3. Call the [Query Members](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/members/members/query-members) endpoint to get the site member data.
4. Map the site members to add to the group to their IDs as returned in step 3.
5. Add the site members to the group by calling the [Add Group Members](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/community/wix-groups/members/add-group-members) endpoint with the site member IDs collected above.

## Manage Bulk Emailing to Group Members
For example, send automated emails to group members.

1. Get all members of a group by calling the [List Group Members](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/community/wix-groups/members/list-group-members) endpoint.
2. From the response, collect the site member IDs.
3. Call the [Query Members](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/members/members/query-members) endpoint, with site member IDs you collected, to get their email addresses.
4. Call the [Query Email Subscriptions](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/marketing/email-subscriptions/query-email-subscriptions) endpoint to confirm that the members have agreed to receive emails from the site owners.
5. Prepare and send the automated emails.

## Provide Analytical Reports
For example, create a report including aggregated group info: total amount of groups created, the most popular groups by member count, idle groups;

1. Get the total amount of groups by calling the [List Groups](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/community/wix-groups/groups/list-groups) endpoint.
2. From the response, collect the metadata total.
3. Get the most popular groups by calling the [Query Groups](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/community/wix-groups/groups/query-groups) endpoint and sorting by group size.
Sample request body:
```json
{
    "query": {
        "sort": [
            {
                "fieldName": "membersCount",
                "order": "DESC"
            }
        ],
        "paging": {
            "offset": 0,
            "limit": 100
        }
    }
}
```
4. Get the idle groups (with the least recent activity) by calling the [Query Groups](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/community/wix-groups/groups/query-groups) endpoint and sorting by date of most recent activity.
Sample request body:
```json
{
    "query": {
        "sort": [
            {
                "fieldName": "recentActivityDate",
                "order": "ASC"
            }
        ],
        "paging": {
            "offset": 0,
            "limit": 100
        }
    }
}
```
5. Prepare and display the report.
