# Terminology
The Groups APIs provide all the functionality required to create and manage groups. 

This article contains a comprehensive list of the various terms and concepts used in the Groups APIs.

## Create request
When a Wix user has not given site members permission to create groups, they can submit a request to create a group. The request can be approved or rejected by a group admin.

## Group

## Groups list
[List of groups](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-groups-about-your-groups-pages#groups-group-list) displayed in the Wix Groups app home page.

  > **Note:** Depending on the viewer's [role](#role), not all groups will be displayed.

## Group member

## Group privacy status
Defines the visibility of a group in a [group list](#group-list) and how a site member can join it.

  - **Public**: Anyone can see the group and its content. Anyone can join the group.
  - **Private**: Anyone can see the group, but only group members can view its content. In order to join the group, site members must submit a [join group request](#join-group-request).
  - **Secret**: Only group members and admins can see the group. It is not possible for site members to submit a [join group request](#join-group-request). Instead, group members and admins can add new members.

## Group settings

## Join group request

  - **Group member:** Site member that has joined a group.
  - **Group admin:** Group member, Wix user, or Wix app with group management permissions. The member that creates a group is automatically a group admin. Also, Wix users are always group admins for all groups on their site.
