# About the Resellers API

With the Resellers API, strategic partners can offer Wix services to their 
customers. You can contact the Wix B2B sales team at bizdev@wix.com to find 
out how to become a reseller and which services you could offer to your 
customers. Resellers are responsible for the complete purchase flow, including 
checkout experience, payment, and post-purchase management. The Wix services 
can be offered both as part of a do-it-yourself (DIY) or do-it-for-me (DIFM) 
flow, as described below. Resold Wix services are available to the customer 
until the reseller actively cancels them.

 
The Resellers APIs allow you to:

+ Create, retrieve, and cancel packages of Wix services.
+ Adjust and cancel product instances that are part of a package.

Learn more about the [Domain Search](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/account-level-apis/domain-search/introduction) 
and [Domain Connections](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/account-level-apis/domain-connections) 
API to offer domains to your customers.

## Before you begin


+ The Resellers API is accessible via API keys, which are currently 
  available to selected beta users only. You won't be able to access this 
  API with a standard Auth header.
+ The response of any endpoint in Resellers API doesn't change depending on 
  whether you use an API key for the account or sub-account, as long as you have 
  the required permissions to all Wix sites relevant to the call.
+ Only selected strategic partners are allowed to resell Wix services. Contact 
  the [Wix B2B sales team](mailto:bizdev@wix.com), if youâ€™d like to become a 
  reseller.
+ Not all Wix services can be resold.
+ Resold Wix services don't have an expiration date. They are available to the 
  customer until the reseller actively cancels them.
+ Currently, you can't use the Resellers API to assign a service to a specific 
  Wix site after a package has been created. But customers or agents can 
  assign floating product instances to sites in their Wix account.
+ Currently, there are no webhooks available for the Resellers API.


## Terminology


+ __Reseller__: Strategic partner that offers Wix services to their customers.
+ __Product Instance__: Specific instance of a Wix service that the reseller 
  provides to one of their customers.
+ __Floating__: A product instance that hasn't been assigned to a Wix site, but 
  only a Wix account. Currently, you can't assign a floating product 
  instance to a site using the Resellers API after you've created the 
  corresponding package. But customers or agents can assign floating instances 
  in the Wix account.
+ __Feature__: Most granular capability or benefit that comes with a service. 
+ __Service Type__: Wix service types are groups of related services. For 
  example, the service type `Premium Plans` includes both the `Website Plan` and 
  `Business & eCommerce Plan` services.
+ __Voucher__: Time-limited benefit for non-Wix services that comes with some 
  products.
+ __Package__: Group of Wix services that the reseller offers to the customer 
  as part of a single transaction. 
+ __Site ID__: Unique identifier of a customer's Wix site. See the 
  [Sites API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/account-level-apis/sites/query-sites) 
  for more details.
+ __DIY__: Do-it-yourself business model. The resellers' customers actively 
  build and manage their sites in the Wix platform.
+ __DIFM__: Do-it-for-me business model. Only employees or agents of the 
  reseller have access to the Wix account.
+ __Account__: A Wix account includes all the assets that site owners interact 
  with: sites, folders, Premium plans, domains, and more. An account can have 
  one or more users. Standard accounts are for a single user, while team 
  accounts allow multiple users to collaborate. Standard and team accounts 
  are the same in all other ways.
  In case of DIY, every customer has their own account and actively builds and 
  manages their sites in the Wix platform. In case of DIFM, the customer doesn't 
  have their own Wix account.
+ __Sub-account__: Resellers can create sub-accounts for their DIY customers. 
  This allows the reseller to access the sites of all their customers while 
  customers can only access their own sites.
+ __Adjust__: Resellers can up- or downgrade the Wix services that they're 
  offering to their customers. For example, you could upgrade a 
  `Business Basic` plan to `Business Unlimited`.
