# Following and Blocking

Members may block each other within the Wix platform.

Blocking hides all member information and activity, including the fact that the block exists, from the blocked member.

Blocks are not currently accessible via REST API.

A member cannot follow or be followed by a member who they block or are blocked by.

If `member A` blocks `member B` any following relationship between `member A` and `member B`will be removed.
