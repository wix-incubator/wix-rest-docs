## Terminology

* **Domain:** Specifies which website is associated with the marketing tag.

    > **Note:** When the site owner changes the domain of a Wix site, the embedded marketing tags wonâ€™t load anymore. To update the domain use the [Upsert Marketing Tags](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/marketing/marketing-tags/upsert-marketing-tags) endpoint. Currently, there is no way to sign up for notifications when a site owner changes their domain name.
* **Tracking ID:** Specifies which external ID is associated with the site owner. Learn more about each tracking ID in the corresponding object description. These are the supported external IDs:

    | Marketing Tag | External ID Name | ID Format| 
    |-|-|-|
    | Google Ads Conversion tag | Conversion ID | AW-123456789 |
    | Google Universal Analytics tag | Analytics ID | UA-12345-1 |
    | Google Analytics 4 tag | Measurement ID | G-12345  |
    | Yandex Metrica tag | Tag number | 123456789 |
    | Facebook Pixel tag | Pixel ID  | 123456789  |
