# About Order Fulfillments

An order fulfillment refers to the process of preparing and delivering orders to customers. This process usually involves receiving orders, picking the products from inventory, packing them securely, providing tracking information, and shipping them to the customer's address.

A fulfillment object contains information about an order's shipping provider, tracking details, and the line items associated with the fulfillment.

With the Order Fulfillments API you can:

* Create fulfillments for some or all items in an order.
* Create fulfillments for multiple orders at once.
* Retrieve fulfillments associated with one or more orders.
* Listen for changes made to orders' fulfillments.
