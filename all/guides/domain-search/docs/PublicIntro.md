# About the Domain Search API


With the Domain Search API you can check the availability of a specific domain 
and help site owners find fitting domains for their sites. The API allows
you to:

- Check whether a specific domain is available for purchase.
- Generate suggestions for available domains.


If you've already bought a domain, you can use the 
[Connect Domain API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/account-level-apis/domain-connections/connect-domain) 
to connect it to a Wix site. 


## Terminology


+ __Domain__: Domain name including TLD.
+ __TLD__: [Top-level domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain). 
  For example, `com`, `net`, or `org`.
+ __Suggestion__: A suggested domain that's available for purchase.


## Before you begin


+ Not all TLDs can be connected to Wix sites. Contact the Wix B2B sales team at 
  [bizdev@wix.com](mailto:bizdev@wix.com) for more information.
+ Currently, you can't use Wix APIs to buy domains. But you can use the 
  [Connect Domain API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/account-level-apis/domain-connections/connect-domain) 
  to connect an already delivered domain to a Wix site.
