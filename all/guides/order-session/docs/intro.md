# Order Session V2

## What is it?

A service that manages the order session during a Wix user checkout flow, from the moment a user has the intent to pay for the order until it was submitted and an invoice was created.

This service should be used if you want to integrate with the Wix Checkout component.

## Onboarding
First of all you have to define your app at https://dev.wix.com and come to us with the appDefId.

Note also that the Order Session service supports only WIX users.

## How does Order Session work?
The Order Session encrypts the order data into a JWE token, which is then returned to the caller as the order_session_id.

## Permissions

Order Session service supports only server-2-server calls that originated from known appDefIds,
the reason for it is because Order Session service is a multi-tenant service and it treats each **appDefId** as a different tenant. 

The API requires BILLING.ORG_MANAGE_ORDER_SESSIONS to create new order session ID
 and BILLING.ORG_READ_ORDER_SESSIONS to get order session by order session ID 

To start working with it, please contact the maintainers in the relevant channels provided in the end of the document. 

## Errors
A number of potential errors can be returned by the service:
*   Status.ExpiredOrderSessionException - trying to get expire order session id .
*   Status.MoreThanOneCouponException - trying to create order session with more than one coupon.
