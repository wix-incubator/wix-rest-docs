# About the Wix eCommerce Shipping Rates SPI

As a shipping provider, you can integrate your shipping rates service with Wix to allow a merchants' stores or businesses to request and use your shipping services on their Wix sites.
The shipping rates are then displayed on the site's cart and checkout pages.

The integration is done via an app in the Wix App Market (created in the [Wix Developers Center](https://dev.wix.com/)) and the Wix Shipping Rates SPI.

Using the SPI, you can design your app to:
+ Provide shipping estimates, including fees and times.
+ Provide shipping rates using your own custom logic.
+ Provide services for delivery and pickup.

+ __Get Shipping Rates__: Wix calls [this SPI endpoint](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-ecommerce/shipping-rates-integration-spi/get-shipping-rates) to retrieve the shipping rates you provide.
+ __Merchant__: Business that offers products on their Wix site to customers.
+ __Wix site owner__: The person managing the merchant's Wix site.
+ __Shipping Rates Provider__: A 3rd-party app that implements custom logic to calculate shipping rates.
