# About Loyalty Accounts

The loyalty accounts API allows a site owner to create and manage its customers' loyalty accounts. The loyalty accounts
maintain a customer's balance of loyalty points. 

With the loyalty accounts API, you can:
+ Create a new loyalty account.
+ Adjust the balance of a loyalty account.
+ Earn points to a loyalty account.
+ Retrieve loyalty accounts and transactions related to those accounts.
+ Handle webhooks when an account is updated or adjusted.

> **Note:**
> Before loyalty accounts can be created, the site's loyalty program must be active.
> See the activate loyalty program endpoint to [learn how to activate the loyalty program using the API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-loyalty-program/program/activate-loyalty-program).
