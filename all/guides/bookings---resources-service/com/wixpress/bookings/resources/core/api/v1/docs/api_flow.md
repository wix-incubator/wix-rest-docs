# About the Resources API

A resource is a business asset like a staff member, a room, or equipment that is needed to provide a service.

Each resource owns a schedule. The schedule defines the resource's availability. You can set up a custom schedule for a resource, use the business's default working hours, or combine the two.

Resources have tags that you can use for grouping. For example, add a `"room"` tag for classroom resources and an `"equipment"` tag for resources like computers and projectors.

There are 2 tags used by the Wix Bookings app:
  + `"staff"`: Resources with the `"staff"` tag appear in the Bookings app's **Staff** page. Resources created using the Wix Bookings UI will be created with the `"staff"` tag.
  + `"business"`: The Bookings app creates a resource with a name and tag value of `"business"`. This resource owns a schedule that contains the operating hours of the business and cannot be deleted. This schedule is used when creating resources that use the businessâ€™s operating hours for the resource's working hours.
 
>**Note:** 
>You can have up to 135 active resources and an additional 135 deleted resources.
