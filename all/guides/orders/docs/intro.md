# About the eCommerce Orders API

An order is created when a site visitor completes the checkout phase of a purchase. Orders can also be created, as well
as managed directly via the eCommerce Orders API.

An order holds information about purchased items, price and tax summaries, shipping and billing info, any applied
discounts, payment and fulfillment statuses, and more.

The eCommerce Orders API will replace the soon-to-be
deprecated [Stores Orders API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-stores/orders)
, [Events Order API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-events/wix-events/order),
and [Bookings API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-bookings/bookings/bookings).
