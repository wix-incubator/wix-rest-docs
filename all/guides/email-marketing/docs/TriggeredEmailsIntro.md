## Triggered Emails Intro

A Triggered Email allows you to send a personalized message to a site member or a contact.

For more information, learn more about how to [create a Triggered Email](https://support.wix.com/en/article/creating-a-triggered-email) in the Business Manager.

Current Limitations:
1. The API supports sending an email to 1 contact at a time.
2. A Triggered Email can only be sent to the current logged-in member or the current registered contact in the current session.
3. There is a daily limit of 200 emails per Triggered Email.

The API can be used from either the client or server side, as long as a session is provided.

Triggered Emails are currently offered as a free service (no premium plan needed), and they are not handled by abuse moderation service.
