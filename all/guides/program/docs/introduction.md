# About Loyalty Program

The loyalty program API allows a site owner to activate their site's loyalty program and manage its details, like the point name and point icon. The loyalty program must be `ACTIVE` to start creating customer loyalty accounts and tracking their point balances.

With the loyalty program API, you can:
+ Activate a loyalty program.
+ Update the name and icon for the program's points.
+ Retrieve a loyalty program.

> **Note:**
> In order to use the loyalty program API, the Wix site owner must first install the Wix Loyalty Program app to their site.
