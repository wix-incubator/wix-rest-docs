# About Loyalty Program

The loyalty program API allows a site owner to activate their site's loyalty program and manage its details, like the point name and point icon. The loyalty program must be `ACTIVE` to start creating customer loyalty accounts and tracking their point balances.

With the loyalty program API, you can:
+ Activate a loyalty program.
+ Update the name and icon for the program's points.
+ Retrieve a loyalty program.

> **Note:**
> In order to use the loyalty program API, the Wix site owner must first install the Wix Loyalty Program app to their site. A site owner can install the app through their [dashboard](https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=Select%20Site&title=Select%20a%20Site&autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&actionUrl=https:%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fdashboard%2F%7B%7BmetaSiteId%7D%7D%2Floyalty-accounts/wizard/) or the [Wix App Market](https://www.wix.com/app-market/loyalty).
