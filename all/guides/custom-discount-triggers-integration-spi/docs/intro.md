# About Custom Discount Triggers SPI

The eCommerce Custom Discount Triggers SPI allows you to provide custom triggers that specify when a discount can apply to a cart/checkout.

Custom triggers play a part in the definition of discount rules - sets of triggers and scopes that together define the necessary conditions for a discount to apply to items in the cart/checkout.

## Before you begin

To use a custom trigger:
+ Provide your custom triggers by implementing the [`listTriggers()`](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-ecommerce/custom-discount-triggers-integration-spi/list-triggers) function.
+ Implement the [`getEligibleTriggers()`](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-ecommerce/custom-discount-triggers-integration-spi/get-eligible-triggers) and provide the logic needed for applying the relevant custom trigger.
+ [Create an automatic discount using the dashboard](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-stores-creating-automatic-discounts), or by using the [Discount Rules API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-ecommerce/discount-rules/create-discount-rule).

The integration is done via an app in the Wix App Market (created in the [Wix Developers Center](https://dev.wix.com/)) and the Wix Custom Discount Triggers SPI.

## Terminology

+ **Custom triggers:** Triggers that can meet any condition you want. For example, a trigger that only fires between 8pm-10pm on Mondays and Thursdays, and only on a rainy day.
