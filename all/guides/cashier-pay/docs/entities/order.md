## Order event hooks

In most cases TPA want to get notifications when something changes with the order. For such cases one must setup an
event hook when [creating an order](/docs/entities//cashier-pay/reference/order/.wix.payment.api.pay.v2.-order-service.-create).

Event hook is either a Web URL (starting with `https://`) or an RPC endpoint (`rpc:${groupId.artifactId}`). In order to
use RPC hook, your TPA must be registered on cashier side as rpc service.

There three types of notifications.

- Order has expired notification.
- Transaction status update notification.
- Subscription status update notification.
