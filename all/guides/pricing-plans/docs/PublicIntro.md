# About Wix Pricing Plans

With [Wix Pricing Plans](https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-pricing-plans), site owners can create plans and sell them to their customers as free, one-time or recurring memberships. 
Wix Pricing Plans provides a customizable pricing page where customers can view the plan perks, prices and other features including free trials, purchase limitations and more. 
All plans either have a duration or can be valid until canceled by a customer. 

## Terminology

- **Plan**: A membership plan or package, offering bundles of features or “perks”. 
  - A **free plan** can be purchased free of charge.
  - A **one-time plan** can be purchased for a single payment.
  - A **recurring plan** charges the customer on a weekly, monthly or yearly basis for selected duration of time.
- **Primary plans**: Plans that are labeled with a ribbon that is customizable in the Wix Pricing Plans UI.
- **Archived plans**: Plans that can no longer be purchased or edited, but existing plan holders can still enjoy purchased membership and will continue to be charged until canceled or expired.
- **Hidden plans**: Plans that are not currently visible to customers. Hidden plans may still be sold manually to customers.
- **Free trial**: A feature allowing the site owner to test out the perks of the plan for a selected amount of days before the first charge. Relevant for recurring plans.
