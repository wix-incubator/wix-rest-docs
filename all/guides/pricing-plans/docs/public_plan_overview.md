# About the Plans API

The Plan entity includes all the details of plans available on a site. 
Using the Plans API, you can create and manage plans, change the visibility and availability of a plan for purchase, and get plan statistics. Plans provides a customizable pricing page where customers can view the plan perks, prices and other features including free trials, purchase limitations and more. 
All plans either have a duration or can be valid until canceled by a customer. 

Use the Plans API to:

- Create & update plans.
- Get statistics about the plans.
- Get specific plan information.
- Arrange display order for plans.
- Hide or archive plans.

## Setting usage limits
Pricing plans can be limited to be purchased only one time by a single customer. By default, customers can make unlimited purchases.
