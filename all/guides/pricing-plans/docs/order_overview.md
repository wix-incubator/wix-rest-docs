- Create an offline order
- Change an order start date
- Mark an order as paid
- Extend and order's duration
- Cancel an order
- Suspend and resume an order

- **Order Status**: An order can have one of the following statuses:

  - ACTIVE - order is active.  
  - CANCELED - order has been canceled.  
  - EXPIRED - order expiration date has passed and is no longer active.
  - PAUSED - order was active, and then paused before the expiration date. The order can be resumed to return it to ACTIVE status with a new expiration date.
  - PENDING_CANCELLATION - the site owner has selected to discontinue (cancel) the order, but the plan service remains active until the end of the current payment period.

## Limitations
- Pricing plan orders created via API can't be paid for using the Wix Payment system.
- The application of tax to orders is defined at the site level, and isn't accessible via API. Site owners can [set up tax collection manually](https://support.wix.com/en/article/pricing-plans-setting-up-tax-collection).
