# About Blog

Wix Blog allows users to create and manage blogs. Site owners can create and manage posts, draft posts, categories and tags on their blog page. Site collaborators can also create and manage blogs, given the appropriate rols and permissions. These roles include: 
- **Blog Editors** can fully manage the blog, but not other areas of a site.
- **Blog Writers** can create and publish their own posts on a blog.
- **Guest Writers** can create posts, but can't publish them. 


With the Wix Blog API, you can: 
- Create and manage posts and draft posts.
- Assign categories to posts and draft posts, as well as update and remove them. 
- Add tags to posts and draft posts, as well as remove them.
