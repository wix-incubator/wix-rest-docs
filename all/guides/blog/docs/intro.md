# About Blog

Wix Blog allows users to create and manage blogs. Site owners can create and manage posts, draft posts, categories and 
tags on their blog page. Site contributers can also create and manage blogs given the appropriate roles and permissions. 

There are 3 types of blog roles: 
- **Blog Editors** can fully manage the blog, but not other areas of a site.
- **Blog Writers** can create and publish their own posts on a blog.
- **Guest Writer** can only create posts. Posts written by guest writers must be reviewed and published by a site owner or blog editor. 


With [Wix Multilangual](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-multilingual-an-overview), a blog can be translated into multiple languages.
