| Account | The account between the merchant and the local delivery service provider. Each account has an ID that the merchant uses to connect to the local delivery service provider.<br> Note: For now, Wix supports 1 account per merchant. In the future, we will support multiple accounts, such as 1 account per configuration. For example, “TallOrders NY” could have an account with a local delivery service provider in NY and “TallOrders CA” could have an account with a different provider. |
| ASAP Order | Orders to deliver or pick up as soon as possible. |
| Branch | Another term for a location. The location can be a store branch, a restaurant branch, or any other business location. See *Location*. |
