# Labels

Labels allow site contributors to segment contacts in their Contact List.
Contact labels are useful for targeting specific audiences
for email campaigns or bulk actions.

With the label APIs, your apps can let site contributors view and manage labels.
The responses can be used to [query contacts][query-contacts]
in subsequent API requests.

For more information on how labels are used,
