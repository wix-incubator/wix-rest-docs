# About This API 

This API exposes basic data about the user's site and the app installed in it, as based on the user's authentication token.  
When you provide the authentication token, you will receive identifying information for the user's site and the app instance parameters.   
The primary identifier returned is the App Instance ID - the unique identifier of the app within the website. Using the App Instance ID, you can retrieve data about the site that installed the app (e.g., locale) and data about the app installed (e.g., current paid plan).
