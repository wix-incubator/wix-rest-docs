# About The Wix Billing API 

This API enables your app to lead customers seamlessly into Wix's checkout process from your platform 
(e.g., hosting your app's pricing page independently and redirecting to Wix checkout for purchase). 
The returned checkout link is valid for 48 hours. Note: Use of this functionality is dependent onÂ setup in the [Wix Developers Center](https://devforum.wix.com/en/article/setting-up-an-external-pricing-page).
