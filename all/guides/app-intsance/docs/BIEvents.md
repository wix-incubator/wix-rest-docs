# About the BI Events API

This API allows 3rd party apps connected to Wix, to send BI events to the Wix system. 
It includes several out-of-the-box events, like when the app dashboard is loaded, or when a primary action is taken (the most valuable action in an app product flow). 
If the list of built-in event does not suit your needs, you can also send a custom event.
