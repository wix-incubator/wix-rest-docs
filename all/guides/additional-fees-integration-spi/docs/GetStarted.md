# About the Wix eCommerce Additional Fees SPI

As an additional fees calculation service provider, you can integrate your service with Wix to allow merchants to request and use your services on their Wix sites.
By integrating your service with Wix, the additional fees are then included on the site's cart and checkout pages.  

The integration is done via an app in the Wix App Market (created in the [Wix Developers Center](https://dev.wix.com/)) and the Wix Additional Fees SPI.  

Using the SPI, you can design your app to calculate various additional fees for your merchant's customers, including:
+ Fragile packaging fees
+ Shipping insurance fees
+ Item warranty fees
+ Gift wrapping fees
+ Carbon offset fees

## Before you begin

It's important to note that when Wix calls your implementation of the [Calculate Additional Fees](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-ecommerce/additional-fees-integration-spi/calculate-additional-fees) SPI endpoint, the app must return fees in the same currency as the Wix site. Extract the `currency` for a site from the [request envelope](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/getting-started/service-provider-interface#getting-started_service-provider-interface_request-envelope) to ensure the correct currency is used in your calculation.


## Terminology

+ __Calculate additional fees__: Wix calls [this SPI endpoint](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-ecommerce/additional-fees-integration-spi/calculate-additional-fees) to retrieve the various additional fees you calculate.
+ __Line items__: Line items to calculate additional fees for. For more information, see [eCommerce Integration in Wix Stores Catalog](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-stores/catalog/ecommerce-integration).
+ __Site owner__: The person managing the merchant's Wix site.
