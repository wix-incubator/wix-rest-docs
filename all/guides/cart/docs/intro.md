# About the eCommerce Cart API

The cart is the first phase of a purchase, followed by checkout, then order.

A cart holds information about purchased items, prices, discounts, site details, buyer IDs (contact and member/visitor) and more.

With the eCommerce Cart API you can:
+ [Get a cart](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-ecommerce/cart/get-cart).
+ [Add catalog items](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-ecommerce/cart/add-to-cart) to a cart.
+ [Create a checkout](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-ecommerce/cart/create-checkout-from-cart) from a cart. 
+ [Estimate a cart's price totals](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-ecommerce/cart/estimate-totals).
+ Update a cart's [properties](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-ecommerce/cart/update-cart) and [line items quantity](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-ecommerce/cart/update-line-items-quantity).
+ [Remove a coupon](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-ecommerce/cart/remove-coupon).
+ [Remove line items](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-ecommerce/cart/remove-line-items) and [delete](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-ecommerce/cart/delete-cart) a cart.
