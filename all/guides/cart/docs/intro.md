# About the eCommerce Cart API

The cart is the first phase of a purchase, followed by checkout, then order.

A cart holds information about purchased items, prices, discounts, site details, buyer IDs (contact and member/visitor) and more.

The eCommerce Cart API currently provides functionality for [retrieving](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/ecommerce/cart/get-cart) carts and listening to events when a cart is [created](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/ecommerce/cart/cart-created-webhook), [updated](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/ecommerce/cart/cart-updated-webhook), and [deleted](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/ecommerce/cart/cart-deleted-webhook).

To assist in migration from the Stores to eCommerce APIs, please refer to the [Stores to eCommerce Cart Conversion Table](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/ecommerce/cart/cart-object-conversion).

Future functionality includes creating and managing carts, as well as creating a checkout from a cart.
