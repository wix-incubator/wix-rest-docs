# About Account Level APIs

The APIs in this category all require an [API key]() as their authorization header.
While some of these calls may take action at the site level, they all require account-level access.

Terminology:
- **Account**: Wix account, including access to associated Wix sites. 
  - **Team Account**: Resellers and other platforms can create a team account to manage their customersâ€™ sites, with access to a large number of sites and share access with customers.
- **API Key**: Authorization key generated in the [API Keys Manager](https://manage.wix.com/account/api-keys).
