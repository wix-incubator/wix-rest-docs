# About Account Level APIs

The APIs in this category all require an [API key](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/account-level-APIs/about-api-keys) as their authorization header.
While some of these calls may take action at the site level, they all require account-level access.

> **Note**: When using an API key, it completely replaces OAuth authentication.

> **Important**: API Keys are currently available to selected beta users only. You will not be able to access any APIs documented in this section with a standard Auth header.

## Terminology:
- **Account**: Wix account, including access to associated Wix sites. 
  - **Team Account**: Resellers and other platforms can create a team account to manage a large number of their customersâ€™ sites, and share access with customers.
- **API Key**: Authorization key generated in the [API Keys Manager](https://manage.wix.com/account/api-keys).
- **Resellers**: Strategic partners that offer Wix services to their customers.
- **Site ID**: Unique identifier of a Wix site.
