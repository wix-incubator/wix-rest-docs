# Developers' Glossary

- **API**: Application Programming Interface. A communication protocol enabling interaction between servers.

- **App Instance**: A set of properties which describe the app within a specific site. These properties include the app instance ID, user ID, premium flag and more.

- **App Settings**: An Editor settings dialog that allows the user to change the look and feel of a specific app.

- **App upgrade**: The process of transforming a free app to a Premium one. Similar to a site upgrade, an app upgrade gives the site owner access to extra content or functionality offered by the app.
