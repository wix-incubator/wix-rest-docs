# Developers' Glossary

- **API**: Application Programming Interface. A communication protocol enabling interaction between servers.

- **App Instance**: A set of properties which describe the app within a specific site. These properties include the app instance ID, user ID, premium flag and more.

- **App Market**: Wix application market where Wix users can browse all available third-party apps and add relevant apps to their site or dashboard.

- **App Settings**: An Editor settings dialog that allows the user to change the look and feel of a specific app.

- **App upgrade**: The process of transforming a free app to a Premium one. Similar to a site upgrade, an app upgrade gives the site owner access to extra content or functionality offered by the app.

- **Client Side**: The runtime version of the app. This is what site visitors will see when visiting the user’s site (as opposed to what the site owner would see from within the Wix Editor).
