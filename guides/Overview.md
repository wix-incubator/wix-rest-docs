# Welcome to Wix's REST API Reference

Third party apps can use our various REST APIs to access Wix site data while serving site owners' needs. 

For example, you can make API calls to read and write to the Wix Stores product catalog on a specific site, manage the site’s orders, and more. 

Our APIs use standard HTTPS terminology and authentication (either [OAuth](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/getting-started/authentication) or [API keys](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/getting-started/about-api-keys)), and return JSON-encoded responses. 

To use our APIs, site owners must grant you explicit permission to collect this data - either when installing your app on their site, or by providing an API key.
