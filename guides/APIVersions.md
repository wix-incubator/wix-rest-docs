# API Versions

As we update and expand our APIs, new versions are released. Here's what you need to know about versions:

## Versioning by API

New versions are released at the service level. 
For example, while the latest version of Wix Bookings' Bookings API might be v2, the latest version of Wix Bookings' Attendance API might be v1.

## Continuing usability
When a new version of an API is released, the earlier version is deprecated. It will remain available for approximately 6 months to give you time to move to the new version.
Deprecated endpoints will include the following note in the docuementation:

<div style="background-color: #DDEAFF; padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #ABCAFE; box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block">
    <b>Deprecation Notice</b>
    <br/>
    <span>This endpoint has been replaced with New Endpoint and will be removed on December 31, 2023. If your app uses this endpoint, we recommend updating your code as soon as possible.</span>
</div>

They will also be added to the [End-of-life notices](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/articles/what-s-new/end-of-life-notices).
