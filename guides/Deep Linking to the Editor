# Deep Linking to the Editor

## Introduction

This API generates a link to the user’s Editor and adds a custom-element component to the stage.

## Authorization

This endpoint requires an authorization header - pass the access token from the [OAuth installation](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/getting-started/authentication) flow.

## Permissions

This endpoint requires the WIX_DEVELOPERS.GET_EDITOR_DEEP_LINK [permission scope](https://devforum.wix.com/en/article/available-permissions) which is included in the Basic scope that is installed by default.

## Using the API

No body is required with this API. If key-value pairs of data are included in a “custom_params” array, they will simply be added to a tab in the custom element’s Settings panel.


### Simple Request

```curl
Curl -X  POST \
https://wixapis.com/apps/v1/post-installation/editor-deep-link \
-H 'Authorization: <AUTH>'
```
The simple request is used to place a custom element on the user’s stage along with the Settings panel, as described below. It is also possible to pass custom parameters with the deep link by adding the parameters to the body of the request.

Request With Custom Parameters

```curl
Curl -X  POST \
https://wixapis.com/apps/v1/post-installation/editor-deep-link \
-H 'Authorization: <AUTH>' \
-header 'Content-Type: application/json'

-data-raw '{
  "custom_params": [
    {
      "param1": "12345",
      "param2”: "abcde"
    }
  ]
}'
```

> Note:
> Parameters sent in the body will be added to the Settings panel of a custom element.


### Response

```json
{
   "url": <url>
}
```

If successful, a URL is returned that sends a user to the editor and adds the custom element to the stage.

If unsuccessful, the returned URL is '1'.

## Custom Elements and the Settings Panel

The custom element is an app component that adds visual control objects as well as a settings panel. When an app with a custom element  is added to the editor, the settings are passed to the settings panel of the custom element.

A custom element is added to an app by selecting **Components > Website Component > Web component > Add Component** :

![Custom Element](./../choose-custom-element.png)

This adds a custom element, along with the settings panel, to the app. The Settings panel has many input and control widgets to manage the custom element.

> Note:
> The Settings panel values are passed as default values that the user is free to adjust.

A deep link can be used to send the app with a custom element and Settings panel to a user's stage.
