# Developer Preview

Wix is always in active development, and we're constantly adding new APIs. We want to make sure that we're on the right track and building the functionality that you need. 
For this reason, we release all of our APIs in Developer Preview mode for user testing. This is a way for us to get feedback from you and improve our APIs before full release.

APIs in Developer Preview mode include the following warning in their introductions:

<div style="background-color: #FEF1D1; padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #FDB10C; box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block">
    <b>Developer Preview</b>
    <br/>
    <span> This API is subject to change. Bug fixes and new features will be released based on developer feedback throughout the preview period.</span>
</div>  

  
They also include this tag in the reference for each endpoint:  
![developer preview tag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89579857/213133550-2b4fa3e8-e8fc-4513-a733-00abcc70925c.png)  
Once these tags are removed, the API is fully released.

Here is some important information to know about Developer Preview:

### Breaking changes 

APIs in Developer Preview are still in development. This means that we may change them at any time, without notice.

### Timeframe 
APIs are expected to stay in Developer Preview mode for approximately 6 months. After that they are fully released, and any breaking changes require a 6 month deprecation notice.

### Feedback
