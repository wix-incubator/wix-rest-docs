# About Wix Loyalty Program

With Wix Loyalty Program, site owners can create a loyalty program to increase customer retention. It allows customers to earn points that they can then redeem for rewards. Each Wix site can have only one loyalty program.

Loyalty APIs allow you to set up and manage a siteâ€™s loyalty program, including settings, customer accounts, and rewards. In the UI, site owners can define automations to give customers points for certain actions, which are not accessible via API. See [Wix Loyalty Program: An Overview](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-loyalty-program-an-overview) for more details.

Loyalty APIs allow your app to:

* Set up the program 
* Customize program and point name, point icon, and description
* Create and manage rewards
* Create customer accounts
* Manage account point balances

## Terminology

* **Program name:** Customizable name of the program.
* **Point name:** Customizable name for the points used in the program.
* **Point icon:** Customizable icon for the points used in the program.
* **Reward:** Defines how many points are needed to get a specific benefit.
* **Program description:** Customizable description of the program that can include text, rich content text, links, pictures, and buttons.
