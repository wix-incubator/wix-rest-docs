# About Wix Coupons  
Wix site owners can [create and manage coupons](https://support.wix.com/en/wix-stores/promoting-stores-sales) to provide their customers with discounts on the products on their site.  

With the Coupons API, your app can manage a site's coupons.  

## Before you begin
- Each coupon must include a scope, including a namespace. To get a list of relevant namespaces for a specific site, [check for installed apps](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/coupons/coupons/introduction#coupons_coupons_introduction_checking-for-installed-apps).
- There is currently no way to receive notifications about site owner actions that affect the viability of the coupons you create (e.g., deleting a product for which your platform has an active coupon).  
- Get familiar with the [Wix coupons' functionality](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/coupons/coupons/functionality).


## Terminology

- **Scope**: Details about [what the coupon should be applied to](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/coupons/coupons/valid-scope-values), including namespace, group, and entity ID.
   - **Namespace**: The Wix app that the coupon should be applied to.
   - **Group**: The type of product, collection of products, service, ticket, or event, within the Wix app, that the coupon should be applied to.
   - **Entity ID**: The specific product, collection of products, service, ticket, or event ID that the coupon should be applied to.
