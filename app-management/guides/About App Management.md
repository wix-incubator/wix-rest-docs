# About App Management
The Wix App Management APIs provide your app with access to basic user data and specific app functionality. 

- The [App Instance API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/app-management/apps/app-instance/introduction) exposes basic data about the site and your app installed on it.
- The [Billing API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/app-management/apps/billing/introduction) enables your app to lead customers seamlessly into Wix's checkout process from your platform.
- The [Embedded Scripts API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/app-management/apps/embedded-scripts/introduction) enables your app to inject custom script tags to the site's <head> tag.
- The [BI Events API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/app-management/apps/bi-event/introduction) enables your app to send BI events to the Wix system.
- The [Editor Deep Link API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/app-management/about-the-editor-deep-link-api) (Beta) enables your app to link to a URL that hat opens the Editor and adds an app's Custom Element component to the site's page.
