# About the App Management APIs

The App Management APIs allow you to manage user specific data for all individual
installations of your app. This includes receiving notifications whenever a new
user installs your app on their site or purchases a Premium version. Additionally,
you can use the APIs to implement an external pricing page and manage usage-based
pricing.

## Terminology

+ __App Instance__: Unique identifier of an app within a specific website. The
  app instance ID is ideal for identifying your users, the specific plan theyâ€™ve
  purchased from you and the features you're supporting for them.
+ __App Pricing__: You can choose the business model that works best for your app.
  Use the [Custom Charges SPI](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/api-reference/app-management/apps/custom-charges-spi/custom-charges-provider-v1/introduction)
  to manage your app's usage-based pricing.
  + __Usage-based pricing__: You charge your users on a recurring, monthly basis.
    You can include a flat base fee and other fees if you want.
    + __Custom Charge__: Adjustable price for using your app. Each billing cycle
      you can add up to 5 charges to an invoice that Wix sends to your customer.
+ __Embedded script__: Script that you can add to a site's `<head>` tag.
